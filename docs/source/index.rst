Dice-plot: a package for high dimensional categorical data visualization
===================================

.. note::
   This project is under active development.


Displaying multidimensional categorical data often poses a challenge in life sciences to get a comprehensive overview of
the underlying data. This is not limited to but holds in particular for pathway analysis across multiple conditions. Here
we developed a visualization concept to create easy to understand and intuitive representation of such data. We provide
the implementation as python as well as R package to ensure easy access and application.
